3. **Exterior and system composition**

**1.3.1 System composition** 

TSVG series high-voltage static var generator is mainly composed of 5 parts,  i.e.  starting  cabinet,  control  cabinet,  power  cabinet,  linked  reactor  (or bypass transformer) and cooling device.  

1) **Starting cabinet** 

Starting cabinet consists of starting switch, starting resistor and lightning arrester.  

TSVG series high-voltage static var generator adopts self-excitation startup. After the main switch is closed, the DC capacitor of power unit will be started through starting resistor at system voltage; when the starting voltage reaches 80% of the rated value, the control system will close the starting switch and start the resistor bypass. 

2) **Control cabinet** 

Control cabinet consists of controller, touch screen, control power supply, relay and air switch.  

Control power supply includes four switch power supplies, i.e. two DC24V power supplies (supplying power for operation of touch screen and relay in redundancy  mode)  and  two  DC12V  power  supplies  (supplying  power  for controller  case  in  redundancy  mode).  Main  control  panel  consists  of  power supply, operation and fault lights, touch screen and emergency stop button. 

Start, stop, reset and local and remote control can be realized through touch 

screen. For specific functions, see Chapter III. 

3) **Power cabinet** 

The main component of power cabinet is power module (also called link).  

The  3kV  power  cabinet  includes  a  three-phase  system  consisting  of  12 power  modules,  every  4  modules  at  each  phase  in  cascade  connection successively;  the  6kV  includes  a  three-phase  system  consisting  of  24  power modules, every 8 modules at each phase in cascade connection successively; the 10kV  power  cabinet  includes  a  three-phase  system  consisting  of  36  power modules, every 12 modules at each phase in cascade connection successively.

4) **Linked reactor (or bypass transformer)** 

The output of device is connected in parallel with the system side through linked reactor or bypass transformer.  

5) **Cooling device** 

Forced air cooling system consists of cooling fan and control circuit, which have been included in the power cabinet and the control cabinet.  

4. **Basic principle of the system**

The elementary wiring diagram of TSVG is as shown in Fig. 1-5, where 

self-commutation voltage source converter is connected in parallel to the power 

grid via transformer or reactor, and through adjustment of the amplitude and phase  of  output  voltage  at  the  AC  side  of  the  voltage  source  converter,  the converter  can  output  continuously  varying  capacitive  or  inductive  reactive current, thus realizing the purpose of reactive compensation. The relation of output  current,  output  voltage  and  system  voltage  of  TSVG  at  no-load, capacitive and inductive operation modes is as shown in Table 1-10:

**Chapter V Fault Description and Troubleshooting** 

1. **Alarm and fault description** 

The  internal  monitoring  unit  of  TSVG  divides  all  information  into  two categories, i.e. alarm information and fault information.  

- Alarm (A) 

Alarm information refers to the information that needs the maintenance personnel’s attention and shall be handled in the following way:  

1) In case of alarm, TSVG will continue running; 
1) Alarm information will be recorded and can be inquired through touch 

screen;  

The  purpose  of  alarm  is  to  indicate  the  potential  risk  and  draw  the maintenance personnel’s attention; maintenance may be carried out at a proper time rather than immediately.  

- Fault (F) 

In case of fault, TSVG will automatically stop running and not be restarted before the fault is eliminated by the maintenance personnel. The troubleshooting method is as follows:  

1) In case of fault, the output of link will be blocked and TSVG will open 

the HV circuit breaker;  

2) The fault will be displayed on the touch screen and recorded and the 

fault light will turn on (red);  

3) Automatic reset of fault is not allowed, and when fault disappears, fault 

reset may be carried out through touch screen.  

In case of link fault leading to necessity for replacement or maintenance of the link, such replacement or maintenance shall not be carried out before the bus 

capacitor of link is fully discharged.
